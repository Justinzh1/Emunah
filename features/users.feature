Feature: Basic users have a variety of actions they can take.
 
  As a member of Emunah's congregation
  So that I can get access to the features provided on the website
  I want to be able to create a basic account

Background: Rabbi (Seth) has been added as a super user of the Emunah organization
  
  Given the following users exist:
  | email                 | password | full_name   | is_admin |
  | seth.martin@gmail.com | abcdef   | Seth Martin | Yes      |
  | wayne.li@berkeley.edu | 123456   | Wayne Li    | No       |

  And I am on the home page
  Then I should see "Welcome to Congregation B'nai Emunah's Internal Tool!"

Scenario: login as admin and create a basic user
  When I fill in "Email" with "seth.martin@gmail.com"
  And I fill in "Password" with "abcdef"
  And I press "Log In"
  Then I should see "Welcome Seth Martin!"
  When I go to the "Create User" page
  And I fill in "Email" with "wesley.wan@eberkeley.edu"
  And I fill in "Password" with "helloworld"
  And I fill in "Full Name" with "Wesley Wan"
  And I select "No" from "Is Admin"
  And I press "Create User"
  Then I should see "Wesley Wan was successfully created."
